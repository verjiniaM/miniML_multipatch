### üß† ABOUT

miniML is a deep-learning-based tool to detect synaptic events in 1d timeseries data. It uses a CNN-LSTM network architecture that was trained using a large dataset of synaptic events. 

In this repository, we provide pretrained models and Python code to run model inference on recorded data. In addition, an application example is included.

### üíª INSTALLATION

To use miniML, clone the GitHub Repositiory and install the requirements. Python dependencies are: sklearn, matplotlib, h5py, pandas, numpy, scipy, tensorflow, pyabf. To install all dependencies, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### ‚è± RUNNING MINIML

First, a miniML *trace* object needs to be created containing 1d timeseries data. Currently, miniML supports loading from HEKA .dat files, Axon .abf files as well as HDF .h5 files. Data in other file formats need to be imported as Python objects.

Next, a miniML *detection* object can be created. Here, one needs to specify a miniML *model* file to use as well as the *trace* object to operate on. 

Finally, model inference can be run using the *detect_events()* method. This method will run miniML over the given data using the specified model. Runtime will depend on data length.


### üí° EXAMPLE

The folder "example_data/" contains an example recording from a MF‚ÄìGC synapse together with a commented Jupyter Notebook ([tutorial](tutorial.ipynb)) illustrating the use of miniML.
