### üß† ABOUT

miniML is a deep-learning-based tool to detect synaptic events in 1d timeseries data. It uses a CNN-LSTM network architecture that was trained using a large dataset of synaptic events from cerebellar mossy fiber to granule cell synapses. 

In this repository, we provide pretrained models and Python code to run model inference on recorded data. In addition, an application example (cerebellar granule cell recording) is included.

### üíª INSTALLATION

To use miniML, clone the GitHub Repositiory and install the requirements. The Python dependencies are: sklearn, matplotlib, h5py, pandas, numpy, scipy, tensorflow, pyabf. To install all dependencies using pip, run the following command in your Python environment:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

miniML can be run on a GPU to speed model inference. Either CUDA or tensorflow-metal are required for GPU use. Installation isntructions for these requirements may depend on the specific hardware and OS and can be found online.

### ‚è± RUNNING MINIML

First, a miniML *MiniTrace* object needs to be created containing 1d timeseries data. Currently, miniML supports direct loading from HEKA .dat files, Axon .abf files as well as HDF .h5 files. The *trace* object features discrete methods for loading from these file formats (e.g., **MiniTrace.from_h5_file()**). Data in other file formats need to be imported as Python objects.

Next, a miniML *EventDetection* object is initiated. Here, one needs to specify a miniML model file to use as well as the *trace* object to operate on. 

Finally, model inference can be run using the **detect_events()** method. This method will run miniML over the given data using the specified model. Runtime will depend on data length.

Detected events are analyzed and descriptive statistics can subsequently be saved in different formats (.pickle, .h5, .csv).


### üí° EXAMPLE

The folder "example_data/" contains an example recording from a cerebellar mossy fiber to granule cell synapse together with a commented Jupyter Notebook ([tutorial](tutorial.ipynb)) illustrating the use of miniML.
